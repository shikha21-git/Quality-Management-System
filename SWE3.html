    <td>As a result of successful implementation of this process:<br>
1) a detailed design is developed that describes software units;<br>
2) interfaces of each software unit are defined;<br>
3) the dynamic behavior of the software units is defined; <br>4) consistency and bidirectional traceability are established between
software requirements and software units; and consistency and
bidirectional traceability are established between software
architectural design and software detailed design; and consistency
and bidirectional traceability are established between software
detailed design and software units; <br>
5) the software detailed design and the relationship to the software
architectural design is agreed and communicated to all affected
parties; and<br>
6) software units defined by the software detailed design are produced.<br>

       <b>SWE.3.BP1: Develop software detailed design.</b> Develop a detailed
design for each software component defined in the software architectural
design that specifies all software units with respect to functional and non functional software requirements. [OUTCOME 1]<br>
<b>SWE.3.BP2: Define interfaces of software units.</b> Identify, specify and
document the interfaces of each software unit. [OUTCOME 2]<br>
<b>SWE.3.BP3: Describe dynamic behavior.</b> Evaluate and document the
dynamic behavior of and the interaction between relevant software units.
[OUTCOME 3]<br>
NOTE 1: Not all software units have dynamic behavior to be described.<br>
<b>SWE.3.BP4: Evaluate software detailed design.</b> Evaluate the software
detailed design in terms of interoperability, interaction, criticality, technical
complexity, risks and testability. [OUTCOME 1,2,3,4]<br>
NOTE 2: The results of the evaluation can be used as input for software unit
verification.<br>
<b>SWE.3.BP5: Establish bidirectional traceability.</b> Establish bidirectional
traceability between software requirements and software units. Establish
bidirectional traceability between the software architectural design and the
software detailed design. Establish bidirectional traceability between the
software detailed design and software units. [OUTCOME 4]<br>
NOTE 3: Redundancy should be avoided by establishing a combination of
these approaches that covers the project and the organizational needs.<br>
NOTE 4: Bidirectional traceability supports coverage, consistency and impact
analysis.<br>
<b>SWE.3.BP6: Ensure consistency.</b> Ensure consistency between software
requirements and software units. Ensure consistency between the software
architectural design, the software detailed design and software units.
[OUTCOME 4]<br>
NOTE 5: Consistency is supported by bidirectional traceability and can be
demonstrated by review records.<br>
<b>SWE.3.BP7: Communicate agreed software detailed design.</b>
Communicate the agreed software detailed design and updates to the
software detailed design to all relevant parties. [OUTCOME 5]<br>
<b>SWE.3.BP8: Develop software units.</b>Develop and document the
executable representations of each software unit according to the software
detailed design. [OUTCOME 6]<br>
