    <td>The purpose of the Software Integration and Integration Test Process is
to integrate the software units into larger software items up to a complete
integrated software consistent with the software architectural design and
to ensure that the software items are tested to provide evidence for
compliance of the integrated software items with the software
architectural design, including the interfaces between the software units
and between the software items.

    <td>As a result of successful implementation of this process:<br>
1) a software integration strategy consistent with the project plan,
release plan and the software architectural design is developed to
integrate the software items;<br>
2) a software integration test strategy including the regression test
strategy is developed to test the software unit and software item
interactions;<br>
3) a specification for software integration test according to the software
integration test strategy is developed that is suitable to provide
evidence for compliance of the integrated software items with the
software architectural design, including the interfaces between the
software units and between the software items;<br>
4) software units and software items are integrated up to a complete
integrated software according to the integration strategy;<br>
5) Test cases included in the software integration test specification are
selected according to the software integration test strategy, and the
release plan;<br>
6) integrated software items are tested using the selected test cases and
the results of software integration test are recorded;<br>
7) consistency and bidirectional traceability are established between the
elements of the software architectural design and the test cases
included in the software integration test specification and between test
cases and test results; and<br>
8) results of the software integration test are summarized and
communicated to all affected parties.<br>

    <th>Base Practices</th>
    <td>
       <b>SWE.5.BP1: Develop software integration strategy.</b> Develop a strategy
for integrating software items consistent with the project plan and release
plan. Identify software items based on the software architectural design and
define a sequence for integrating them. [OUTCOME 1]<br>
<b>SWE.5.BP2: Develop software integration test strategy including
regression test strategy.</b> Develop a strategy for testing the integrated
software items following the integration strategy. This includes a regression
test strategy for re-testing integrated software items if a software item is
changed. [OUTCOME 2]<br>
<b>SWE.5.BP3: Develop specification for software integration test.</b>
Develop the test specification for software integration test including the test
cases according to the software integration test strategy for each integrated
software item. The test specification shall be suitable to provide evidencefor compliance of the integrated software items with the software
architectural design. [OUTCOME 3]<br>
NOTE 1: Compliance to the architectural design means that the specified
integration tests are suitable to prove that the interfaces between the software
units and between the software items fulfill the specification given by the
software architectural design.<br>
NOTE 2: The software integration test cases may focus on<br>
• the correct dataflow between software items<br>
• the timeliness and timing dependencies of dataflow between software
items <br>
• the correct interpretation of data by all software items using an interface<br>
• the dynamic interaction between software items<br>
• the compliance to resource consumption objectives of interfaces<br>
<b>SWE.5.BP4: Integrate software units and software items.</b> Integrate the
software units to software items and software items to integrated software
according to the software integration strategy. [OUTCOME 4]<br>
<b>SWE.5.BP5: Select test cases. Select test cases from the software
integration test specification.</b> The selection of test cases shall have
sufficient coverage according to the software integration test strategy and
the release plan. [OUTCOME 5]<br>
<b>SWE.5.BP6: Perform software integration test.</b> Perform the software
integration test using the selected test cases. Record the integration test
results and logs. [OUTCOME 6]<br>
NOTE 4: See SUP.9 for handling of non-conformances.<br>
NOTE 5: The software integration test may be supported by using hardware
debug interfaces or simulation environments (e.g. Software-in-the-LoopSimulation).<br>
<b>SWE.5.BP7: Establish bidirectional traceability.</b> Establish bidirectional
traceability between elements of the software architectural design and test
cases included in the software integration test specification. Establish
bidirectional traceability between test cases included in the software
integration test specification and software integration test results. [OUTCOME
7]<br>
NOTE 6: Bidirectional traceability supports coverage, consistency and impact
analysis.<br>
<b>SWE.5.BP8: Ensure consistency.</b> Ensure consistency between elements
of the software architectural design and test cases included in the software
integration test specification. [OUTCOME 7]<br>
NOTE 7: Consistency is supported by bidirectional traceability and can be
demonstrated by review records.<br>
<b>SWE.5.BP9: Summarize and communicate results.</b> Summarize the
software integration test results and communicate them to all affected
parties. [OUTCOME 8]<br>
NOTE 8: Providing all necessary information from the test case execution in a
summary enables other parties to judge the consequences.<br>
