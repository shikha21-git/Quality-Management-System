                system architectural design and identify which system requirements are to
                be allocated to which elements of the system, and to evaluate the system
                architectural design against defined criteria.</td>

                2) the system requirements are allocated to the elements of the system;<br>

                system requirements and system architectural design; and<br>

            <td>
                <b>SYS.3.BP1: Develop system architectural design.</b> Develop and
                document the system architectural design that specifies the elements of thex
                system with respect to functional and non-functional system requirements.
                [OUTCOME 1]<br>
                NOTE 1: The development of system architectural design typically includes the
                decomposition into elements across appropriate hierarchical levels.<br>
                <b>SYS.3.BP2: Allocate system requirements.</b>. Allocate the system
                requirements to the elements of the system architectural design. [OUTCOME
                2]<br>
                <b>SYS.3.BP3: Define interfaces of system elements.</b> Identify, develop and
                document the interfaces of each system element. [OUTCOME 3]<br>
                <b>SYS.3.BP4: Describe dynamic behavior.</b> Evaluate and document the
                dynamic behavior of the interaction between system elements. [OUTCOME 4]<br>
                NOTE 2: Dynamic behavior is determined by operating modes (e.g. start-up,
                shutdown, normal mode, calibration, diagnosis, etc.).<br>
                <b>SYS.3.BP5: Evaluate alternative system architectures.</b> Define
                evaluation criteria for the architecture. Evaluate alternative system
                architectures according to the defined criteria. Record the rationale for the
                chosen system architecture. [OUTCOME 1]<br>
                NOTE 3: Evaluation criteria may include quality characteristics (modularity,
                maintainability, expandability, scalability, reliability, security realization and
                usability) and results of make-buy-reuse analysis.<br>
                <b>SYS.3.BP6: Establish bidirectional traceability.</b> Establish bidirectional
                traceability between system requirements and elements of the system
                architectural design. [OUTCOME 5]<br>
                NOTE 4: Bidirectional traceability covers allocation of system requirements to
                the elements of the system architectural design.<br>
                NOTE 5: Bidirectional traceability supports coverage, consistency and impact
                analysis.<br>
                <b>SYS.3.BP7: Ensure consistency.</b> Ensure consistency between system
                requirements and the system architectural design. [OUTCOME 1, 2, 5, 6]<br>
                NOTE 6: Consistency is supported by bidirectional traceability and can be
                demonstrated by review records.<br>
                NOTE 7: System requirements typically include system architectural
                requirements. Refer to BP5.<br>
                <b>SYS.3.BP8: Communicate agreed system architectural design.</b>
                Communicate the agreed system architectural design and updates to
                system architectural design to all relevant parties. [OUTCOME 6]<br>
