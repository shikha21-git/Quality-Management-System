    <td>
      <b>SUP.1.BP1: Develop a project quality assurance strategy.</b> Develop a 
      strategy in order to ensure that work product and process quality assurance 
      is performed at project level independently and objectively without conflicts 
      of interest. [OUTCOME 1, 2]<br>
      NOTE 1: Aspects of independence may be financial and/or organizational 
      structure.<br>
      NOTE 2: Quality assurance may be coordinated with, and make use of, the 
      results of other processes such as verification, validation, joint review, audit 
      and problem management.<br>
      NOTE 3: Process quality assurance may include process assessments and 
      audits, problem analysis, regular check of methods, tools, documents and the 
      adherence to defined processes, reports and lessons learned that improve 
      processes for future projects.<br>
      NOTE 4: Work product quality assurance may include reviews, problem 
      analysis, reports and lessons learned that improve the work products for 
      further use.<br>
      <b>SUP.1.BP2: Assure quality of work products.</b> Perform the activities 
      according to the quality assurance strategy and the project schedule to 
      ensure that the work products meet the defined work product requirements 
      and document the results. [OUTCOME 2, 3, 4]<br>
      NOTE 5: Relevant work product requirements may include requirements from 
      applicable standards.<br>
      NOTE 6: Non-conformances detected in work products may be entered into 
      the problem resolution management process (SUP.9) to document, analyze, 
      resolve, track to closure and prevent the problems.<br>
      <b>SUP.1.BP3: Assure quality of process activities.</b> Perform the activities 
      according to the quality assurance strategy and the project schedule to 
      ensure that the processes meet their defined goals and document the 
      results. [OUTCOME 2, 3, 4]<br>
      NOTE 7: Relevant process goals may include goals from applicable standards.<br>
      NOTE 8: Problems detected in the process definition or implementation may 
      be entered into a process improvement process (PIM.3) to describe, record, 
      analyze, resolve, track to closure and prevent the problems.<br>
      <b>SUP.1.BP4: Summarize and communicate quality assurance activities 
      and results.</b> Regularly report performance, deviations, and trends of 
      quality assurance activities to relevant parties for information and action 
      according to the quality assurance strategy. [OUTCOME 3, 4]<br>
      <b>SUP.1.BP5: Ensure resolution of non-conformances.</b> Deviations or 
      non-conformance found in process and product quality assurance activities 
      should be analyzed, tracked, corrected, and further prevented.
      [OUTCOME 3,6]<br>
      <b>SUP.1.BP6: Implement an escalation mechanism.</b> Establish and 
      maintain an escalation mechanism according to the quality assurance 
      strategy that ensures that quality assurance may escalate problems to 
      appropriate levels of management and other relevant stakeholders to 
      resolve them. [OUTCOME 5, 6].<br>
