    <td>As a result of successful implementation of this process:
1) a system qualification test strategy including regression test strategy
consistent with the project plan and release plan is developed to test
the integrated system;<br>
2) a specification for system qualification test of the integrated system
according to the system qualification test strategy is developed that is
suitable to provide evidence for compliance with the system
requirements;<br>
3) test cases included in the system qualification test specification are
selected according to the system qualification test strategy and the
release plan;<br>
4) the integrated system is tested using the selected test cases and the
results of system qualification test are recorded;<br>
5) consistency and bidirectional traceability are established between
system requirements and test cases included in the system
qualification test specification and between test cases and test results;
and<br>
6) results of the system qualification test are summarized and
communicated to all affected parties.</td>

        <b>SYS.5.BP1: Develop system qualification test strategy including
regression test strategy.</b>Develop a strategy for system qualification test
consistent with the project plan and the release plan. This includes a
regression test strategy for re-testing the integrated system if a system item
is changed. [OUTCOME 1]<br>
<b>SYS.5.BP2: Develop specification for system qualification test.</b>
Develop the specification for system qualification test including test cases
based on the verification criteria according to the system qualification test
strategy. The test specification shall be suitable to provide evidence for
compliance of the integrated system with the system requirements.
[OUTCOME 2]<br>
<b>SYS.5.BP3: Select test cases. Select test cases from the system
qualification test specification.</b> The selection of test cases shall have
sufficient coverage according to the system qualification test strategy and
the release plan. [OUTCOME 3]<br>
<b>SYS.5.BP4: Test integrated system.</b> Test the integrated system using the
selected test cases. Record the system qualification test results and logs.
[OUTCOME 4]<br>
NOTE 1: See SUP.9 for handling of non-conformances.<br>
<b>SYS.5.BP5: Establish bidirectional traceability.</b> Establish bidirectional
traceability between system requirements and test cases included in the
system qualification test specification. Establish bidirectional traceability
between test cases included in the system qualification test specification
and system qualification test results. [OUTCOME 5]<br>
NOTE 2: Bidirectional traceability supports coverage, consistency and impact
analysis.<br>
<b>SYS.5.BP6: Ensure consistency.</b> Ensure consistency between system
requirements and test cases included in the system qualification test
specification. [OUTCOME 5]<br>
NOTE 3: Consistency is supported by bidirectional traceability and can be
demonstrated by review records.<br>
<b>SYS.5.BP7: Summarize and communicate results.</b>
 Summarize the system qualification test results and communicate them to all affected
parties. [OUTCOME 6]<br>
NOTE 4: Providing all necessary information from the test case execution in a
summary enables other parties to judge the consequences.<br>
