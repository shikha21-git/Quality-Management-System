    <b> SUP.9.BP1: Develop a problem resolution management strategy.</b>
Develop a problem resolution management strategy, including problem
resolution activities, a status model for the problems, alert notifications,
responsibilities for performing these activities and an urgent resolutionstrategy. Interfaces to affected parties are defined and definitions are
maintained. [OUTCOME 1]<br>
NOTE 1: Problem resolution activities can be different during the product life
cycle, e.g. during prototype construction and series development.<br>
<b>SUP.9.BP2: Identify and record the problem.</b> Each problem is uniquely
identified, described and recorded. Supporting information should be
provided to reproduce and diagnose the problem. [OUTCOME 2]<br>
NOTE 2: Supporting information typically includes the origin of the problem,
how it can be reproduced, environmental information, by whom it has been
detected, etc.<br>
NOTE 3: Unique identification supports traceability to changes made.<br>
<b>SUP.9.BP3: Record the status of problems.</b> A status according to the
status model is assigned to each problem to facilitate tracking. [OUTCOME 6]<br>
<b>SUP.9.BP4: Diagnose the cause and determine the impact of the
problem.</b> Investigate the problem and determine its cause and impact in
order to categorize the problem and to determine appropriate actions.
[OUTCOME 2, 3]<br>
NOTE 4: Problem categorization (e.g. A, B, C, light, medium, severe) may be
based on severity, impact, criticality, urgency, relevance for the change
process, etc.<br>
<b>SUP.9.BP5: Authorize urgent resolution action.</b> If according to the
strategy a problem requires an urgent resolution, authorization shall be
obtained for immediate action also according to the strategy. [OUTCOME 4]<br>
<b>SUP.9.BP6: Raise alert notifications.</b> If according to the strategy the
problem has a high impact on other systems or other affected parties, an
alert notification needs to be raised also according to the strategy.
[OUTCOME 4]<br>
<b>SUP.9.BP7: Initiate problem resolution.</b> Initiate appropriate actions
according to the strategy to resolve the problem including review of those
actions, or initiate a change request. [OUTCOME 4]<br>
NOTE 5: Appropriate actions may include the initiating of a change request.
See SUP.10 for managing of change requests.<br>
NOTE 6: The implementation of process improvements (to prevent problems)
is done in the process improvement process (PIM.3).The implementation of
generic project management improvements (e.g. lessons learned) are part of
the project management process (MAN.3). The implementation of generic
work product related improvements are part of the quality assurance process
(SUP.1).<br>
<b>SUP.9.BP8: Track problems to closure.</b> Track the status of problems to
closure including all related change requests. A formal acceptance has to
be authorized before closing the problem. [OUTCOME 5, 6]<br>
<b>SUP.9.BP9: Analyze problem trends.</b> Collect and analyze problem
resolution management data, identify trends, and initiate project related
actions, according to the strategy. [OUTCOME 6]<br>
