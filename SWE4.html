    <td>As a result of successful implementation of this process:<br>
1) a software unit verification strategy including regression strategy is
developed to verify the software units;<br>
2) criteria for software unit verification are developed according to the
software unit verification strategy that are suitable to provide evidence
for compliance of the software units with the software detailed design
and with the non-functional software requirements;<br>
3) software units are verified according to the software unit verification
strategy and the defined criteria for software unit verification and the
results are recorded;<br>
4) consistency and bidirectional traceability are established between
software units, criteria for verification and verification results; and<br>
5) results of the unit verification are summarized and communicated to
all affected parties.<br>

    <td>
       <b>SWE.4.BP1: Develop software unit verification strategy including
regression strategy.</b> Develop a strategy for verification of the software
units including regression strategy for re-verification if a software unit is
changed. The verification strategy shall define how to provide evidence for
compliance of the software units with the software detailed design and with
the non-functional requirements. [OUTCOME 1]<br>
NOTE 1: Possible techniques for unit verification include static/dynamic
analysis, code reviews, unit testing etc.<br>
<b>SWE.4.BP2: Develop criteria for unit verification.</b> Develop criteria for
unit verification that are suitable to provide evidence for compliance of the
software units, and their interactions within the component, with the
software detailed design and with the non-functional requirements
according to the verification strategy. For unit testing, criteria shall be
defined in a unit test specification. [OUTCOME 2]<br>
NOTE 2: Possible criteria for unit verification include unit test cases, unit test
data, static verification, coverage goals and coding standards such as the
MISRA rules.<br>
NOTE 3: The unit test specification may be implemented e.g. as a script in an
automated test bench.<br>
<b>SWE.4.BP3: Perform static verification of software units.</b> Verify
software units for correctness using the defined criteria for verification.
Record the results of the static verification. [OUTCOME 3]<br>
NOTE 4: Static verification may include static analysis, code reviews, checks
against coding standards and guidelines, and other techniques.<br>
NOTE 5: See SUP.9 for handling of non-conformances.<br>
<b>SWE.4.BP4: Test software units.</b> Test software units using the unit test
specification according to the software unit verification strategy. Record the
test results and logs. [OUTCOME 3]<br>
NOTE 6: See SUP.9 for handling of non-conformances.<br>
<b>SWE.4.BP5: Establish bidirectional traceability.</b> Establish bidirectional
traceability between software units and static verification results. Establish
bidirectional traceability between the software detailed design and the unit
test specification. Establish bidirectional traceability between the unit test
specification and unit test results. [OUTCOME 4]<br>
NOTE 7: Bidirectional traceability supports coverage, consistency and impact
analysis.<br>
<b>SWE.4.BP6: Ensure consistency.</b> Ensure consistency between the
software detailed design and the unit test specification. [OUTCOME 4]<br>
NOTE 8: Consistency is supported by bidirectional traceability and can be
demonstrated by review records.<br>
<b>SWE.4.BP7: Summarize and communicate results.</b> Summarize the unit
test results and static verification results and communicate them to all
affected parties. [OUTCOME 5]<br>
NOTE 9: Providing all necessary information from the test case execution in a
summary enables other parties to judge the consequences.<br>
