an architectural design and to identify which software requirements are to
be allocated to which elements of the software, and to evaluate the
software architectural design against defined criteria.

1) a software architectural design is defined that identifies the elements
of the software;<br>
2) the software requirements are allocated to the elements of the
software; <br>
3) the interfaces of each software element are defined;<br>
4) the dynamic behavior and resource consumption objectives of the
software elements are defined;<br>
5) consistency and bidirectional traceability are established between
software requirements and software architectural design; and<br>

    <th>Base Practices</th>
    <td>
       <b>SWE.2.BP1: Develop software architectural design.</b> Develop and
document the software architectural design that specifies the elements of
the software with respect to functional and non-functional software
requirements. [OUTCOME 1]<br>
NOTE 1: The software is decomposed into elements across appropriate
hierarchical levels down to the software components (the lowest level
elements of the software architectural design) that are described in the
detailed design.<br>
<b>SWE.2.BP2: Allocate software requirements.</b> Allocate the software
requirements to the elements of the software architectural design.
[OUTCOME 2]<br>
<b>SWE.2.BP3: Define interfaces of software elements.</b> Identify, develop
and document the interfaces of each software element. [OUTCOME 3]<br>
<b>SWE.2.BP4: Describe dynamic behavior.</b> Evaluate and document the
timing and dynamic interaction of software elements to meet the required
dynamic behavior of the system. [OUTCOME 4]<br>
NOTE 2: Dynamic behavior is determined by operating modes (e.g. start-up,
shutdown, normal mode, calibration, diagnosis, etc.), processes and process
intercommunication, tasks, threads, time slices, interrupts, etc.<br>
NOTE 3: During evaluation of the dynamic behavior the target platform and
potential loads on the target should be considered.<br>
<b>SWE.2.BP5: Define resource consumption objectives.</b>Determine and
document the resource consumption objectives for all relevant elements of
the software architectural design on the appropriate hierarchical level.
[OUTCOME 4]<br>
NOTE 4: Resource consumption is typically determined for resources like
Memory (ROM, RAM, external / internal EEPROM or Data Flash), CPU load,
etc.<br>
<b>SWE.2.BP6: Evaluate alternative software architectures.</b> Define
evaluation criteria for the architecture. Evaluate alternative software
architectures according to the defined criteria. Record the rationale for the
chosen software architecture. [OUTCOME 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]<br>
NOTE 5: Evaluation criteria may include quality characteristics (modularity,
maintainability, expandability, scalability, reliability, security realization and
usability) and results of make-buy-reuse analysis.<br>
<b>SWE.2.BP7: Establish bidirectional traceability.</b> Establish bidirectional
traceability between software requirements and elements of the software
architectural design. [OUTCOME 5]<br>
NOTE 6: Bidirectional traceability covers allocation of software requirements to
the elements of the software architectural design. <br>
NOTE 7: Bidirectional traceability supports coverage, consistency and impact
analysis.<br>
<b>SWE.2.BP8: Ensure consistency.</b> Ensure consistency between software
requirements and the software architectural design. [OUTCOME 1, 2, 5, 6]<br>
NOTE 8: Consistency is supported by bidirectional traceability and can be
demonstrated by review records.<br>
<b>SWE.2.BP9: Communicate agreed software architectural design.</b>
Communicate the agreed software architectural design and updates to
software architectural design to all relevant parties. [OUTCOME 6]<br>
