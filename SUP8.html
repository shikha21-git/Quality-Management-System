    <th>Base Practices</th>
    <td>
      <b>SUP.8.BP1: Develop a configuration management strategy.</b> Develop a 
      configuration management strategy, including <br>
      • responsibilities;<br>
      • tools and repositories;<br>
      • criteria for configuration items;<br>
      • naming conventions;<br>
      • access rights;<br>
      • criteria for baselines;<br>
      • merge and branch strategy;<br>
      • the revision history approach for configuration items
      [OUTCOME 1]<br>
      NOTE 1: The configuration management strategy typically supports the 
      handling of product/software variants which may be caused by different sets of 
      application parameters or by other causes.<br>
      NOTE 2: The branch management strategy specifies in which cases branching 
      is permissible, whether authorization is required, how branches are merged, 
      and which activities are required to verify that all changes have been 
      consistently integrated without damage to other changes or to the original 
      software.<br>
      <b>SUP.8.BP2: Identify configuration items.</b> Identify and document 
      configuration items according to the configuration management strategy. 
      [OUTCOME 2]<br>
      NOTE 3: Configuration control is typically applied for the products that are 
      delivered to the customer, designated internal work products, acquired 
      products, tools and other configuration items that are used in creating and 
      describing these work products.<br>
      <b>SUP.8.BP3: Establish a configuration management system.</b> Establish 
      a configuration management system according to the configuration 
      management strategy. [OUTCOME 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7]<br>
      <b>SUP.8.BP4: Establish branch management.</b> Establish branch 
      management according to the configuration management strategy where 
      applicable for parallel developments that use the same base. [OUTCOME 1,
      3, 4, 6, 7]<br>
      <b>SUP.8.BP5: Control modifications and releases.</b> Establish mechanisms 
      for control of the configuration items according to the configuration 
      management strategy, and control modifications and releases using these 
      mechanisms. [OUTCOME 3, 4, 5]<br>
      <b>SUP.8.BP6: Establish baselines.</b> Establish baselines for internal 
      purposes and for external delivery according to the configuration 
      management strategy. [OUTCOME 2]<br>
      NOTE 4: For baseline issues refer also to the product release process SPL.2.<br>
      <b>SUP.8.BP7: Report configuration status.</b> Record and report status of 
      configuration items to support project management and other relevant 
      processes. [OUTCOME 5]<br>
      NOTE 5: Regular reporting of the configuration status (e.g. how many 
configuration items are currently under work, checked in, tested, released, 
etc.) supports project management activities and dedicated project phases like 
software integration.<br>
<b>SUP.8.BP8: Verify the information about configured items.</b> Verify that 
the information about configured items, and their baselines is complete and 
ensure the consistency of baselines. [OUTCOME 6]<br>
NOTE 6: A typical implementation is performing baseline and configuration 
management audits.<br>
<b>SUP.8.BP9: Manage the storage of configuration items and baselines.</b>
Ensure the integrity and availability of configuration items and baselines 
through appropriate scheduling and resourcing of storage, archiving (long 
term storage) and backup of the used CM systems. [OUTCOME 4, 5, 6, 7]<br>
NOTE 7: Backup, storage and archiving may need to extend beyond the 
guaranteed lifetime of available storage media. Relevant configuration items 
affected may include those referenced in note 2 and note 3. Availability may be 
specified by contract requirements.<br>
