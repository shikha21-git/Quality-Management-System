transform the software related parts of the system requirements into a set
of software requirements.

    <td>As a result of successful implementation of this process:<br>
1) the software requirements to be allocated to the software elements of
the system and their interfaces are defined;<br>
2) software requirements are categorized and analyzed for correctness
and verifiability;<br>
3) the impact of software requirements on the operating environment is
analyzed;<br>
4) prioritization for implementing the software requirements is defined;<br>
5) the software requirements are updated as needed;<br>
6) consistency and bidirectional traceability are established between
system requirements and software requirements; and consistency and
bidirectional traceability are established between system architectural
design and software requirements;<br>

technical impact; and <br>

    <th>Base Practices</th>
    <td>
       <b>SWE.1.BP1: Specify software requirements.</b> Use the system
requirements and the system architecture and changes to system
requirements and architecture to identify the required functions and
capabilities of the software. Specify functional and non-functional software
requirements in a software requirements specification. [OUTCOME 1, 5, 7]<br>
NOTE 1: Application parameter influencing functions and capabilities are part
of the system requirements.<br>
NOTE 2: In case of software development only, the system requirements and
the system architecture refer to a given operating environment (see also
note 5). In that case, stakeholder requirements should be used as the basis for
identifying the required functions and capabilities of the software as well as for
identifying application parameters influencing software functions and
capabilities.<br>
<b>SWE.1.BP2: Structure software requirements.</b> Structure the software
requirements in the software requirements specification by e.g.<br>
• grouping to project relevant clusters,<br>
• sorting in a logical order for the project,<br>
• categorizing based on relevant criteria for the project,<br>
• prioritizing according to stakeholder needs.
[OUTCOME 2, 4]<br>
NOTE 3: Prioritizing typically includes the assignment of software content to
planned releases. Refer to SPL.2.BP1.<br>
<b>SWE.1.BP3: Analyze software requirements.</b> Analyze the specified
software requirements including their interdependencies to ensure
correctness, technical feasibility and verifiability, and to support risk
identification. Analyze the impact on cost, schedule and the technical
impact. [OUTCOME 2, 7]<br>
NOTE 4: The analysis of impact on cost and schedule supports the adjustment
of project estimates. Refer to MAN.3.BP5.<br>
<b>SWE.1.BP4: Analyze the impact on the operating environment.</b>
Analyze the impact that the software requirements will have on interfaces
of system elements and the operating environment. [OUTCOME 3, 7]<br>
NOTE 5: The operating environment is defined as the system in which the
software executes (e.g. hardware, operating system, etc.).<br>
<b>SWE.1.BP5: Develop verification criteria.</b> Develop the verification
criteria for each software requirement that define the qualitative and
quantitative measures for the verification of a requirement. [OUTCOME 2, 7]<br>
NOTE 6: Verification criteria demonstrate that a requirement can be verified
within agreed constraints and is typically used as the input for the development
of the software test cases or other verification measures that should
demonstrate compliance with the software requirements.<br>
NOTE 7: Verification which cannot be covered by testing is covered by SUP.2.<br>
<b>SWE.1.BP6: Establish bidirectional traceability.</b> Establish bidirectional
traceability between system requirements and software requirements.
Establish bidirectional traceability between the system architecture and
software requirements. [OUTCOME 6]<br>
NOTE 8: Redundancy should be avoided by establishing a combination of
these approaches that covers the project and the organizational needs.<br>
NOTE 9: Bidirectional traceability supports coverage, consistency and impact
analysis.<br>
<b>SWE.1.BP7: Ensure consistency.</b>Ensure consistency between system
requirements and software requirements. Ensure consistency between the
system architecture and software requirements. [OUTCOME 6]<br>
NOTE 10: Consistency is supported by bidirectional traceability and can be
demonstrated by review records.<br>
NOTE 11: In case of software development only, the system requirements and
system architecture refer to a given operating environment (see also note 2).
In that case, consistency and bidirectional traceability have to be ensured
between stakeholder requirements and software requirements.<br>
<b>SWE.1.BP8: Communicate agreed software requirements.</b>
Communicate the agreed software requirements and updates to software
requirements to all relevant parties. [OUTCOME 8]<br>
