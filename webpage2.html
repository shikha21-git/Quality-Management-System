transform the defined stakeholder requirements into a set of system
requirements that will guide the design of the system.</td>

    <td>As a result of successful implementation of this process:<br>
1) a defined set of system requirements is established;<br>
2) system requirements are categorized and analyzed for correctness
and verifiability;<br>
3) the impact of system requirements on the operating environment is
analyzed;<br>
4) prioritization for implementing the system requirements is defined;<br>
5) the system requirements are updated as needed;<br>
6) consistency and bidirectional traceability are established between
stakeholder requirements and system requirements;<br>

technical impact; and<br>

    <th>Base Practices</th>
    <td>
        <b>SYS.2.BP1: Specify system requirements.</b> Use the stakeholder
requirements and changes to the stakeholder requirements to identify the
required functions and capabilities of the system. Specify functional and
non-functional system requirements in a system requirements
specification. [OUTCOME 1, 5, 7]<br>
NOTE 1: Application parameter influencing functions and capabilities are part
of the system requirements.<br>
NOTE 2: For changes to the stakeholder's requirements SUP.10 applies.<br>
<b>SYS.2.BP2: Structure system requirements.</b> Structure the system
requirements in the system requirements specification by e.g.
• grouping to project relevant clusters,
• sorting in a logical order for the project,
• categorizing based on relevant criteria for the project,
• prioritizing according to stakeholder needs.
[OUTCOME 2, 4]<br>
NOTE 3: Prioritizing typically includes the assignment of functional content to
planned releases. Refer to SPL.2.BP1.<br>
<b>SYS.2.BP3: Analyze system requirements.</b> Analyze the specified system
requirements including their interdependencies to ensure correctness,
technical feasibility and verifiability, and to support risk identification.
Analyze the impact on cost, schedule and the technical impact. [OUTCOME
1, 2, 7]<br>
NOTE 4: The analysis of impact on cost and schedule supports the adjustment
of project estimates. Refer to MAN.3.BP5.<br>
<b>SYS.2.BP4: Analyze the impact on the operating environment.</b> Identify
the interfaces between the specified system and other elements of the
operating environment. Analyze the impact that the system requirements
will have on these interfaces and the operating environment. [OUTCOME 3, 7]<br>
<b>SYS.2.BP5: Develop verification criteria.</b> Develop the verification criteria
for each system requirement that define the qualitative and quantitative
measures for the verification of a requirement. [OUTCOME 2, 7]<br>
NOTE 5: Verification criteria demonstrate that a requirement can be verified
within agreed constraints and is typically used as the input for the development
of the system test cases or other verification measures that ensures
compliance with the system requirements.<br>
NOTE 6: Verification which cannot be covered by testing is covered by SUP.2.<br>
<b>SYS.2.BP6: Establish bidirectional traceability.</b> Establish bidirectional
traceability between stakeholder requirements and system requirements.
[OUTCOME 6]<br>
NOTE 7: Bidirectional traceability supports coverage, consistency and impact
analysis.<br>
<b>SYS.2.BP7: Ensure consistency.</b> Ensure consistency between
stakeholder requirements and system requirements. [OUTCOME 6]<br>
NOTE 8: Consistency is supported by bidirectional traceability and can be
demonstrated by review records.<br>
<b>SYS.2.BP8: Communicate agreed system requirements. </b>Communicate
the agreed system requirements and updates to system requirements to all
relevant parties. [OUTCOME 8]<br>
