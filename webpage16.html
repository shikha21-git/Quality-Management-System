                resources and constraints is evaluated;<br>

                recurrence of problems identified in the project is prevented.

                <b>MAN.3.BP1: Define the scope of work.</b> Identify the project's goals,
                motivation and boundaries. [OUTCOME 1]<br>
                <b>MAN.3.BP2: Define project life cycle.</b> Define the life cycle for the project,
                which is appropriate to the scope, context, magnitude and complexity of the
                project. [OUTCOME 2]<br>
                NOTE 1: This typically means that the project life cycle and the customer's
                development process are consistent with each other.<br>
                <b>MAN.3.BP3: Evaluate feasibility of the project.</b> Evaluate the feasibility
                of achieving the goals of the project in terms of technical feasibility within
                constraints with respect to time, project estimates, and available resources.
                [OUTCOME 2]<br>
                <b>MAN.3.BP4: Define, monitor and adjust project activities.</b> Define,
                monitor and adjust project activities and their dependencies according to
                defined project life cycle and estimations. Adjust activities and their
                dependencies as required. [OUTCOME 3, 5, 7]<br>
                NOTE 2: A structure and a manageable size of the activities and related work
                packages support an adequate progress monitoring. <br>
                NOTE 3: Project activities typically cover engineering, management and
                supporting processes.<br>
                <b>MAN.3.BP5: Define, monitor and adjust project estimates and
                    resources.</b> Define, monitor and adjust project estimates of effort and
                resources based on project's goals, project risks, motivation and
                boundaries. [OUTCOME 2, 3, 7]<br>
                NOTE 4: Appropriate estimation methods should be used.<br>
                NOTE 5: Examples of necessary resources are people, infrastructure (such as
                tools, test equipment, communication mechanisms...) and hardware/materials.<br>
                NOTE 6: Project risks (using MAN.5) and quality criteria (using SUP.1) may be
                considered.<br>
                NOTE 7: Estimations and resources typically include engineering,
                management and supporting processes.<br>
                <b>MAN.3.BP6: Ensure required skills, knowledge, and experience.</b>
                Identify the required skills, knowledge, and experience for the project in line
                with the estimates and make sure the selected individuals and teams either
                have or acquire these in time. [OUTCOME 3, 7]<br>
                NOTE 8: In the case of deviations from required skills and knowledge trainings
                are typically provided.<br>
                <b>MAN.3.BP7: Identify, monitor and adjust project interfaces and agreed
                    commitments.</b> Identify and agree interfaces of the project with other (sub-
                ) projects, organizational units and other affected stakeholders and monitor
                agreed commitments. [OUTCOME 4, 7]<br>
                NOTE 9: Project interfaces relate to engineering, management and supporting
                processes.<br>
                <b>MAN.3.BP8: Define, monitor and adjust project schedule.</b> Allocate
                resources to activities, and schedule each activity of the whole project. The
                schedule has to be kept continuously updated during lifetime of the project.
                [OUTCOME 3, 5, 7]<br>
                NOTE 10: This relates to all engineering, management and supporting
                processes.<br>
                <b>MAN.3.BP9: Ensure consistency.</b> Ensure that estimates, skills, activities,
                schedules, plans, interfaces, and commitments for the project are
                consistent across affected parties. [OUTCOME 3, 4, 5, 7]<br>
                <b>MAN.3.BP10: Review and report progress of the project.</b> Regularly
                review and report the status of the project and the fulfillment of activities
                against estimated effort and duration to all affected parties. Prevent
                recurrence of problems identified. [OUTCOME 6, 7]<br>
                NOTE 11: Project reviews may be executed at regular intervals by the
                management. At the end of a project, a project review contributes to identifying
                e.g. best practices and lessons learned.<br>
