    <td>As a result of successful implementation of this process:<br>
1) a software qualification test strategy including regression test strategy
consistent with the project plan and release plan is developed to test
the integrated software;<br>
2) a specification for software qualification test of the integrated software
according to the software qualification test strategy is developed that
is suitable to provide evidence for compliance with the software
requirements;<br>
3) test cases included in the software qualification test specification are
selected according to the software qualification test strategy and the
release plan;<br>
4) the integrated software is tested using the selected test cases and the
results of software qualification test are recorded;<br>
5) consistency and bidirectional traceability are established between
software requirements and software qualification test specification
including test cases and between test cases and test results; and<br>
6) results of the software qualification test are summarized and
communicated to all affected parties.<br>

      <b>SWE.6.BP1: Develop software qualification test strategy including
regression test strategy.</b> Develop a strategy for software qualification
testing consistent with the project plan and the release plan. This includes
a regression test strategy for re-testing the integrated software if a software
item is changed. [OUTCOME 1]<br>
<b>SWE.6.BP2: Develop specification for software qualification test.</b>
Develop the specification for software qualification test including test cases
based on the verification criteria, according to the software test strategy.
The test specification shall be suitable to provide evidence for compliance
of the integrated software with the software requirements. [OUTCOME 2]<br>
  <b>SWE.6.BP3: Select test cases.</b> Select test cases from the software test
specification. The selection of test cases shall have sufficient coverage
according to the software test strategy and the release plan. [OUTCOME 3]<br>
<b>SWE.6.BP4: Test integrated software.</b> Test the integrated software using
the selected test cases. Record the software test results and logs. [OUTCOME
4]<br>
NOTE 1: See SUP.9 for handling of non-conformances.<br>
<b>SWE.6.BP5: Establish bidirectional traceability.</b> Establish bidirectional
traceability between software requirements and test cases included in the
software qualification test specification. Establish bidirectional traceability
between test cases included in the software qualification test specification
and software qualification test results. [OUTCOME 5]<br>
NOTE 2: Bidirectional traceability supports coverage, consistency and impact
analysis.<br>
<b>SWE.6.BP6: Ensure consistency.</b> Ensure consistency between software
requirements and test cases included in the software qualification test
specification. [OUTCOME 5]<br>
NOTE 3: Consistency is supported by bidirectional traceability and can be
demonstrated by review records.<br>
<b>SWE.6.BP7: Summarize and communicate results.</b> Summarize the
software qualification test results and communicate them to all affected
parties. [OUTCOME 6]<br>
NOTE 4: Providing all necessary information from the test case execution in a
summary enables other parties to judge the consequences.<br>
