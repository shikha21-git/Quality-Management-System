     <b>SUP.10.BP1: Develop a change request management strategy.</b>
Develop a change request management strategy, including change request
activities, a status model for the change requests, analysis criteria, and
responsibilities for performing these activities. Interfaces to affected parties
are defined and maintained. [OUTCOME 1]<br>
NOTE 1: A status model for change requests may contain: open, under
investigation, approved for implementation, allocated, implemented, fixed,
closed, etc.<br>
NOTE 2: Typical analysis criteria are: resource requirements, scheduling
issues, risks, benefits, etc.<br>
NOTE 3: Change request activities ensure that change requests are
systematically identified, described, recorded, analyzed, implemented, and
managed.<br>NOTE 4: The change request management strategy may cover different
proceedings across the product life cycle, e.g. during prototype construction
and series development. <br>
<b>SUP.10.BP2: Identify and record the change requests.</b> Each change
request is uniquely identified, described, and recorded according to the
strategy, including the initiator and reason of the change request. [OUTCOME
2, 3]<br>
<b>SUP.10.BP3: Record the status of change requests.</b> A status according
to the status model is assigned to each change request to facilitate tracking.
[OUTCOME 8]<br>
<b>SUP.10.BP4: Analyze and assess change requests.</b> Change requests
are analyzed according to the strategy including their dependencies to
affected work products and other change requests. Assess the impact of
the change requests and establish criteria for confirming implementation.
[OUTCOME 3, 4, 5, 9]<br>
<b>SUP.10.BP5: Approve change requests before implementation.</b>
Change requests are prioritized based on analysis results and availability
of resources before implementation and approved according to the
strategy. [OUTCOME 6]<br>
NOTE 5: A Change Control Board (CCB) is a common mechanism used to
approve change requests.<br>
NOTE 6: Prioritization of change requests may be done by allocation to
releases.<br>
<b>SUP.10.BP6: Review the implementation of change requests.</b>
The implementation of change requests is reviewed before closure to
ensure that their criteria for confirming implementation are satisfied, and
that all relevant processes have been applied. [OUTCOME 7, 8]<br>
<b>SUP.10.BP7: Track change requests to closure.</b> Change requests are
tracked until closure. Feedback to the initiator is provided. [OUTCOME 7, 8]<br>
<b>SUP.10.BP8: Establish bidirectional traceability.</b> Establish bidirectional
traceability between change requests and work products affected by the
change requests. In case that the change request is initiated by a problem,
establish bidirectional traceability between change requests and the
corresponding problem reports. [OUTCOME 9]<br>
NOTE 7: Bidirectional traceability supports consistency, completeness and
impact analysis.
