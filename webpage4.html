    <td>The purpose of the System Integration and Integration Test Process is to
integrate the system items to produce an integrated system consistent
with the system architectural design and to ensure that the system items
are tested to provide evidence for compliance of the integrated system
items with the system architectural design, including the interfaces
between system items.

    <td>As a result of successful implementation of this process:<br>
1) a system integration strategy consistent with the project plan, the
release plan and the system architectural design is developed to
integrate the system items;<br>
2) a system integration test strategy including the regression test
strategy is developed to test the system item interactions;
3) a specification for system integration test according to the system
integration test strategy is developed that is suitable to provide
evidence for compliance of the integrated system items with the
system architectural design, including the interfaces between system
items;<br>
4) system items are integrated up to a complete integrated system
according to the integration strategy;<br>
5) test cases included in the system integration test specification are
selected according to the system integration test strategy and the
release plan;<br>
6) system item interactions are tested using the selected test cases and
the results of system integration testing are recorded;<br>
7) consistency and bidirectional traceability between the elements of the
system architectural design and test cases included in the system
integration test specification and bidirectional traceability between test
cases and test results is established; and<br>
8) results of the system integration test are summarized and
communicated to all affected parties.</td>

    <th>Base Practices</th>
    <td>
       <b>SYS.4.BP1: Develop system integration strategy.</b> Develop a strategy for
integrating the system items consistent with the project plan and the
release plan. Identify system items based on the system architectural
design and define a sequence for integrating them. [OUTCOME 1]<br>
<b>SYS.4.BP2: Develop system integration test strategy including
regression test strategy.</b> Develop a strategy for testing the integrated
system items following the integration strategy. This includes a regression
test strategy for re-testing integrated system items if a system item is
changed. [OUTCOME 2]<br>
<b>SYS.4.BP3: Develop specification for system integration test.</b> Develop
the test specification for system integration test including the test cases for
each integration step of a system item according to the system integration
test strategy. The test specification shall be suitable to provide evidence for
compliance of the integrated system items with the system architectural
design. [OUTCOME 3]<br>
NOTE 1: The interface descriptions between system elements are an input for
the system integration test cases.<br>
NOTE 2: Compliance to the architectural design means that the specified
integration tests are suitable to prove that the interfaces between the system
items fulfill the specification given by the system architectural design.<br>
NOTE 3: The system integration test cases may focus on<br>
• the correct signal flow between system items<br>
• the timeliness and timing dependencies of signal flow between system
items<br>
• the correct interpretation of signals by all system items using an interface<br>
• the dynamic interaction between system items<br>
NOTE 4: The system integration test may be supported using simulation of the
environment (e.g. Hardware-in-the-Loop simulation, vehicle network
simulations, digital mock-up).<br>
<b>SYS.4.BP4: Integrate system items.</b> Integrate the system items to an
integrated system according to the system integration strategy. [OUTCOME 4]<br>
NOTE 5: The system integration can be performed step wise integrating
system items (e.g. the hardware elements as prototype hardware, peripherals
(sensors and actuators), the mechanics and integrated software) to produce a
system consistent with the system architectural design.<br>
<b>SYS.4.BP5: Select test cases.</b> Select test cases from the system
integration test specification. The selection of test cases shall have
sufficient coverage according to the system integration test strategy and
the release plan. [OUTCOME 5]<br>
<b>SYS.4.BP6: Perform system integration test.</b>Perform the system
integration test using the selected test cases. Record the integration test
results and logs. [OUTCOME 6]<br>
NOTE 6: See SUP.9 for handling of non-conformances.<br>
<b>SYS.4.BP7: Establish bidirectional traceability.</b>Establish bidirectional
traceability between elements of the system architectural design and test
cases included in the system integration test specification.
Establish bidirectional traceability between test cases included in the
system integration test specification and system integration test results.
[OUTCOME 7]<br>
NOTE 7: Bidirectional traceability supports coverage, consistency and impact
analysis.<br>
<b>SYS.4.BP8: Ensure consistency.</b>Ensure consistency between elements
of the system architectural design and test cases included in the system
integration test specification. [OUTCOME 7]<br>
NOTE 8: Consistency is supported by bidirectional traceability and can be
demonstrated by review records.<br>
<b>SYS.4.BP9: Summarize and communicate results.</b> Summarize the
system integration test results and communicate them to all affected
parties. [OUTCOME 8]<br>
NOTE 9: Providing all necessary information from the test case execution in a
summary enables other parties to judge the consequences.<br>
